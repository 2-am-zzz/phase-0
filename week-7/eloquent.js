// Eloquent JavaScript
/*
Introduction

	Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?
		Not really. It was a good refresher to see how far we've come 
		in programming, but overall, I am familiar with the concepts presented.

	Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?
		Nope, I'm good so far. This book is fairly well written and I hope it is
		just as informative in future chapters.

Ch. 1: Values, Types, and Operators
	Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby 
	syntax with regard to numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and 
	various operators.

		Similarities:
			Unary, Binary, and Ternary operators work in the same way 
			and have the same syntax.

			Conditionals work in the same way most of the time.

		Differences:
			While Ruby has some added functionality on its binary operators, 
			Javascript has a lot more automatic type conversion and will return 
			a result no matter what.

			Javascript has some interesting use cases for && and || determining 
			what to return when values are not a simple true/false comparison. 
			Ruby, as I know it, does not support this.

Ch. 2: Program Structure  
	What is an expression?
	
	What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they always required?

	What causes a variable to return undefined?

	Write your own variable and do something to it in the eloquent.js file.

	What does console.log do and when would you use it? What Ruby method(s) is 
	this similar to?

	Write a short program that asks for a user to input their favorite food. 
	After they hit return, have the program respond with "Hey! That's my 
	favorite too!" (You will probably need to run this in the Chrome console 
	 rather than node since node does not support 
	prompt or alert). Paste your program into the eloquent.js file.

	Describe while and for loops

	What other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript did you
	notice in this section?

	Complete at least one of the exercises (Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, 
	of Chess Board) in the eloquent.js file.

Ch. 3: Functions (Skip the sections on closure and recursion)
	What are the differences between local and global variables in JavaScript?
	When should you use functions?

	What is a function declaration?
	
	Complete the minimum exercise in the eloquent.js file.

Ch. 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays  
	Skip the sections on the Lycanthrope's log, Computing Correlations, and 
	sections from Further Arrayology to the Global Object, but read the 
	chapter summary.

	What is the difference between using a dot and a bracket to look up a 
	property? Ex. array.max vs array["max"]

	Create an object called me that stores your name, age, three favorite foods, 
	and a quirk in your eloquent.js file.

	What is a JavaScript object with a name and value property similar to in 
	Ruby?
