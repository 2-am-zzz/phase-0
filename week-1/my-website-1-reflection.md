## Questions
* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  0. Make sure you've made an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and have the [git](https://git-scm.com/) program installed on your computer.
  1. On [GitHub](https://github.com/), either:
     + Click on the plus sign next to the bell and your avatar in the upper right hand corner of the front page. After that, click **New repository**.
     + Click on the green button labeled **+ New repository** on the right sidebar in the section labeled **Your repositories**.
  2. Under **Owner**, make sure it's set to the proper owner, which is usually the username you used to create a GitHub account.
  3. Under **Repository name**, type in a descriptive name for your new repository.
  4. Under **Description**, fill out a short descriptor about the purpose of your repository.
  5. With the options of **Public** or **Private**, make sure you have **Public** selected. Public repositories are free on GitHub and encourage an open source philosophy.
  6. Check the box next to **Initialize this repository with a README**.
  7. Ignore the **Add .gitignore** option for now.
  8. Under **Add a license**, choose the license that suits your needs. Unsure of what license to use? Check out [http://choosealicense.com/](http://choosealicense.com/) to help you decide!
  9. Click the green button labeled **Create repository**. Voila! You've made your repository on GitHub!
  10. On the repository page that GitHub has redirected you to, look for a web link under the format of **https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPO-NAME].git**. Copy this web link somewhere for future reference.
  11. *On your host computer*, open up **git bash**.
  12. Use git bash to navigate to the place you'd like to clone your repository to.
  13. When there, type in **git clone [REPO-LINK]** where [REPO-LINK] is the link you copied earlier. If it prompts you for a username and password, use your username and password from GitHub.
  14. After the command is done, you should be able to see your repository as a folder on your computer!
* Describe what open source means.
  + When a product is described as **open source**, it means that anyone who own the product also has access to the product's inner workings, such as its design. When applied to software, it means users have access to the **source code** of the program. 
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  + I personally like open source. It encourages curiosity, innovation, and a sense of mutual trust and community among users. It also make sense commercially, since adoption of software is critical to that software's success.
* Assess the importance of using licenses.
  + Licenses define the exact terms of using the software, since the definition of the breadth of an open source license varies among individuals. Some licenses focus on protecting creators, while other licenses encourage distribution while discouraging modification. 
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  + I am now very comfortable with the idea of branching. It used to be a scary concept, having all these branches working at once, but the core idea is actually very simple; I see now how useful it is to have branches for development. I imagine in the future that merging will be more complex than this, but for now, everything is good. Setting up the webpage was straightforward since I had some experience setting up github.io pages in the past.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  + [http://choosealicense.com/](http://choosealicense.com/) was useful for explaning the different types of licenses.
  + GitHub actually has an interactive course for learning GitHub with a training repository, available for free. If you visit [https://training.github.com/classes/developers/](https://training.github.com/classes/developers/) and click the **On-demand** tab next to **Virtual** and **In-person**, you can sign up for the course!
