    - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
        It was pretty sweet. Especially when working with a partner, the excitement of seeing your page come to life from the tools you've been given is a great feeling.
    - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
        Using the semantic elements kept everything fairly organized. By reading the HTML5 tags, it was easier to determine where the headers and footers started and ended. As we construct more complex websites, these new semantic tags will be critical in organizing our sites.
    - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
        By indenting properly, using HTML5 compliant markup, avoiding inline formatting, and only using the tags that would be necessary to emulate the website, we tried to emulate as many best practices as we currently are aware of.
    - What seems good and bad about HTML?
        HTML is good for organizing your content in a fairly straightforward manner, but there is a bit of a struggle in keeping track of the nested tags. As you can see in our table example it is very easy for a tag to be misplaced and the entire formatting to be ruined.
    - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
        There are no tricks specifically, just that by remembering what an abbreviation for a tag stands for, it helps with an overall understanding of the HTML and thus memorization of the tag.
